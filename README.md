# MediBlock
## MediBlock is a prescription handling platform powered by blockchain

Prescription fraud and abuse is a damaging problem that has long plagued the pharmaceutical industry. Working within IBM's Watson Health division and experiencing IBM's global influence at the crossroads of humanity and technology, we see the opportunity for new technologies such as blockchain to alleviate social issues such as this. Mediblock is our team's implementation of a blockchain for prescription pharmaceuticals. 

By acting as a secure and distributed ledger, Mediblock can easily validate and monitor prescriptions, ensuring that only doctors have the power to prescribe medication, that prescriptions are filled accurately, and that sensitive patient information pertaining to prescriptions can be protected in alignment with GDPR standards.

With countless applications including easier transitions for patients when switching healthcare providers, emergency paramedics' improved access to medical data, and greater transparency while protecting individual privacy, one thing is clear:

The value-add for patients, prescribers, and pharmacists cannot be overstated.

In the United States alone, the pharmaceutical market cap is well over $500 billion, and this industry must be increasingly regulated to protect against hostile actors.

One example of this is Williamson, West Virginia. It is a small town of 3,000, but between 2008 and 2015 more than 20.8 million prescription painkillers were shipped to the two pharmacies in this town. 

Knowing this to be true, we believe there is a major market opportunity for IBM in this space. 

There are over 4 billion annual prescriptions dispensed in the United States each year. The use of a blockchain, granting each patient their own private key, lends way to an unprecedented addressable market and a forward-thinking, innovative opportunity for IBM.
